// URL and don't care about all the nitty-gritty details.
//
// NOTE(willchan): Only one "IO" thread is supported for URLFetcher.  This is a
// temporary situation.  We will work on allowing support for multiple "io"

// To use this class, create an instance with the desired URL and a pointer to
// the object to be notified when the URL has been loaded:

//                                        URLFetcher::GET, this);
//
// Then, optionally set properties on this object, like the request context or
// extra headers:
//   fetcher->SetExtraRequestHeaders("X-Foo: bar");
//
// Finally, start the request:
//   fetcher->Start();
//
// The object you supply as a delegate must inherit from URLFetcher::Delegate;
// when the fetch is completed, OnURLFetchComplete() will be called with the
// resulting status and (if applicable) HTTP response code.  From that point
// until the original URLFetcher instance is destroyed, you may examine the
// provided status and data for the URL.  (You should copy these objects if you
// need them to live longer than the URLFetcher instance.)  If the URLFetcher
// instance is destroyed before the callback happens, the fetch will be
// canceled and no callback will occur.
//
// You may create the URLFetcher instance on any thread; OnURLFetchComplete()
// will be called back on the same thread you use to create the instance.
//
//
// NOTE: By default URLFetcher requests are NOT intercepted, except when
// interception is explicitly enabled in tests.
