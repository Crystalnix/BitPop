// Helper to ensure that a file won't be corrupted by the write (for example on
// application crash). Consider a naive way to save an important file F:
//
// 1. Open F for writing, truncating it.
// 2. Write new data to F.
//
// It's good when it works, but it gets very bad if step 2. doesn't complete.
// It can be caused by a crash, a computer hang, or a weird I/O error. And you
// end up with a broken file.
//
// To be safe, we don't start with writing directly to F. Instead, we write to
// to a temporary file. Only after that write is successful, we rename the
// temporary file to target filename.
//
// If you want to know more about this approach and ext3/ext4 fsync issues, see
// http://valhenson.livejournal.com/37921.html
