<p id="classSummary">
  Use the <code>chrome.experimental.clear</code> module to remove browsing data
  from a user's local profile. This module is still experimental. For more
  information regarding the usage of experimental APIs, see the
  <a href="experimental.html">chrome.experimental.* APIs</a> page.
</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>
  You must declare the "clear" permission in the
  <a href="manifest.html">extension manifest</a> to use this API. As the API is
  still experimental, you must declare the "experimental" permisson as well.
</p>

  "name": "My extension",

    "clear",

  ]</b>,

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>
  This API provides a time-based mechanism for clearing a user's browsing data.
  Your code should provide a timestamp which indicates the historical date after
  which the user's browsing data should be removed. This timestamp is formatted
  as the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (which can be retrieved
  from a JavaScript <code>Date</code> object via the <code>getTime</code>
  method).
</p>

<p>
  For example, to clear all of a user's browsing data from the last week, you
  might write code as follows:
</p>

<pre>var callback = function () {
  // Do something clever here once data has been removed.
};

var millisecondsPerWeek = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7;
var oneWeekAgo = (new Date()).getTime() - millisecondsPerWeek;
chrome.experimental.clear.browsingData(oneWeekAgo, {
  "appcache": true,
  "cache": true,
  "cookies": true,
  "downloads": true,
  "fileSystems": true,
  "formData": true,
  "history": true,
  "indexedDB": true,
  "localStorage": true,
  "pluginData": true,
  "passwords": true,
  "webSQL": true
}, callback);</pre>

<p>
  The <code>chrome.experimental.clear.browsingData</code> method allows you to
  remove various types of browsing data with a single call, and will be much
  faster than calling multiple more specific methods. If, however, you only
  want to clear one specific type of browsing data (cookies, for example), the
  more granular methods offer a readable alternative to a call filled with JSON.
</p>

<pre>var callback = function () {
  // Do something clever here once data has been removed.
};

var millisecondsPerWeek = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7;
var oneWeekAgo = (new Date()).getTime() - millisecondsPerWeek;
chrome.experimental.clear.cookies(oneWeekAgo, callback);</pre>

<p class="caution">
  <strong>Important</strong>: Removing browsing data involves a good deal of
  heavy lifting in the background, and can take <em>tens of seconds</em> to
  complete, depending on a user's profile. You should use the callback mechanism
  to keep your users up to date on the removal's status.
</p>
