Use the <code>chrome.experimental.webNavigation</code> module to recieve
notifications about the status of navigations requests in-flight. This
module is still very much experimental. For information on how to use
experimental APIs, see the <a href="experimental.html">chrome.experimental.*
APIs</a> page.

<h2>A note about timestamps</h2>
<p>
It's important to note that some technical oddities in the OS's handling
of distinct Chrome processes can cause the clock to be skewed between the
browser itself and extension processes. That means that WebNavigation's events'
<code>timeStamp</code> property is only guaranteed to be <i>internally</i>
consistent. Comparing one event to another event will give you the correct
offset between them, but comparing them to the current time inside the
extension (via <code>(new Date()).getTime()</code>, for instance) might give
unexpected results.
