<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
Debugger API exposes Google Chrome debugging interface to the extensions.
Debugging messages that are being sent and received are all JSON objects
with the structure defined by the Developer Tools / Web Inspector Protocol.
We are currently drafting this protocol, it is by no means ready and stable,
but we can already expose the way to attach to a given tab and instrument it.
Although not finalized, this API is feature rich. There is a proof of concept
implementation of the Chrome Developer Tools front-end running as an extension
using the debugger API.
</p>

<p>
Note that attaching to the page by means of the debugger API and using embedded
Chrome Developer Tools with it are mutually exclusive. If extension is attached
to the page and user invokes Developer Tools, debugging session is being
terminated. Extension can then re-establish it via attaching to a tab later.
