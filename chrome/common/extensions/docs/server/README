This directory contains the App Engine server code that hosts the Chrome
Extensions documentation at http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the server locally

1. Install the Python App Engine SDK for your platform:
   http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

2. Use the installed development server to serve the contents of this directory:
   http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/devserver.html

   Typically, this will be something like (run from this directory)

     /path/to/dev_appserver.py --post=8080 .

3. Navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or whatever port you specified)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deploying the server to code.google.com:

You will need to have access to the appropriate appspot.com app. Contact
aa@chromium.org or kurrik@chromium.org to obtain access.

Once you have access:

1. Increment the version in app.yaml so we can roll back if the update breaks.

2. Run appcfg.py (supplied with the App Engine SDK) to upload the server code:

    appcfg.py update .

3. When prompted for your credentials, enter the information for the account
   that has access to the production app.

4. Go to http://www.appspot.com, select the docs project, click "versions" in
   the sidebar, and make the version you just deployed the "default" version.

   If you get an error about too many versions when deploying, go into this
   view and delete the version which was deployed the longest time ago.  Then
   try to deploy again.
