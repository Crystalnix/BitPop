<p>
The media galleries API allows you to access media files (images,
video, audio) from the user's local disks (with the user's consent).
</p>

<p>
Using the API, you can prompt the user for permission to access the media
galleries. The permission dialog will contain common media locations for
the platform and will allow the user to add additional locations. From those
locations, only media files will be present in the file system objects.

<p>The media galleries API has two axes of permissions; the locations that
can be accessed, and the type of access (read-only, read-write, add-files).</p>

<p>On the location axis, specifying no location-type permission means that
no media galleries are accessible until the user grants permission to
specific media galleries at runtime using the media gallery configuration
dialog. This dialog can be programmatically triggered.  Alternatively,
specifying the "mediaGalleriesAllGalleries" permission grants access to all
auto-detected media galleries on the user's computer. However, this
permission displays an install time prompt indicating that the extension
will have access to all of the user's media files.</p>

<p>On the access type axis, the "mediaGalleriesRead" permission grants the
extension the right to read files. This permission does not trigger an install
time permission prompt because the user must still grant access to particular
galleries, either with the "mediaGalleriesAllGalleries" permission or at
runtime by using the media gallery management dialog. For example:</p>

<pre>{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    <b>"mediaGalleriesAllGalleries"</b>
    <b>"mediaGalleriesRead"</b>
  ],
  ...
}</pre>

<p>This set of permissions will trigger an install time permission prompt
and let the extension read from all auto-detected media galleries on the
user's computer. The user may add or remove galleries using the
media gallery management dialog, after which the extension will be able
to read all the media files from galleries that the user has selected.</p>

<p>Currently "mediaGalleriesRead" is the only access type supported by
this API. Read-write and add-file access with be implemented soon.</p>
