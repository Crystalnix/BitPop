<h1>Manage Data</h1>


<p>
Almost every aspect of app development involves some element
of sending or receiving data.
Starting with the basics,
you should use an MVC framework to help you design and implement your app
so that data is completely separate from the app's view on that data
(see <a href="app_frameworks.html">MVC Architecture</a>).
</p>

<p>
You also need to think about how data is handled when your app is offline
(see <a href="offline_apps.html">Offline First</a>).
This doc briefly introduces the storage options
for sending, receiving, and saving data locally;
the remainder of the doc shows you how
to use Chrome's File System API
(see also the <a href="fileSystem.html">fileSystem API</a>).
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>API Samples: </b>

and <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/storage">storage</a> samples.
</p>

<h2 id="options">Storage options</h2>

<p>
Packaged apps use many different mechanisms
to send and receive data.
For external data (resources, web pages),
you need to be aware of the
<a href="app_csp.html">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a>.
Similar to Chrome Extensions,
you can use
<a href="app_external.html#external">cross-origin XMLHttpRequests</a>
to communicate with remote servers.
You can also isolate external pages,
so that the rest of your app is secure
(see <a href="app_external.html#objecttag">Embed external web pages</a>).
With Web Intents,
your app can share data with other apps
(see <a href="app_intents.html">Connect Apps with Web Intents</a>).
</p>

<p>
When saving data locally,
you can use the <a href="storage.html">Chrome Storage API</a>
to save small amounts of string data and
IndexedDB to save structured data.
With IndexedDB, you can persist JavaScript objects
to an object store and use the store's indexes to query data
(to learn more, see HTML5 Rock's
<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/indexeddb/todo/">Simple Todo List Tutorial</a>).
For all other types of data,
like binary data,
use the Filesystem API.
</p>

<p>
Chrome's Filesystem API extends the
<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/file/filesystem/">HTML5 FileSystem API</a>;
apps can create, read, navigate,
and write to a sandboxed section
of the user's local file system.
With Chrome's File System API,
packaged apps can read and write files
to user-selected locations.
For example,
a photo-sharing app can use the File System API
to read and write any photos that a user selects.
</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Adding file system permission</h2>

<p>
To use Chrome's File System API,
you need to add the "fileSystem" permission to the manifest,
so that you can obtain permission from the user
to store persistent data.

<pre>
"permissions": [
  "...",
  "fileSystem"
]
</pre>

<h2 id="import">User-options for selecting files</h2>

<p>
Users expect to select files
in the same way they always do.
At a minimum,
they expect a 'choose file' button
and standard file-chooser.
If your app makes heavy use of file-handing,
you should also implement drag-and-drop
(see below and also check out 
<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/dnd/basics/">Native HTML5 Drag and Drop</a>).
</p>

<p>
If your app connects with other apps using
<a href="app_intents.html">Web Intents</a>
you can set up data sharing with those apps.
Users can view and/or write
to their files using a connected app
without having to do all sorts of extra steps
to move files back and forth.
</p>

<h2 id="path">Obtaining the path of a fileEntry</h2>

<p>
To get the full path
of the file the user selected,
<code>fileEntry</code>,
call <code>getDisplayPath()</code>:
</p>

<pre>
function displayPath(fileEntry) {
  chrome.fileSystem.getDisplayPath(fileEntry, function(path) {
    console.log(path)
  });
}
</pre>

<h2 id="drag">Implementing drag-and-drop</h2>

<p>
If you need to implement drag-and-drop selection,
the drag-and-drop file controller
(<code>dnd.js</code>) in
the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/filesystem-access">filesystem-access</a>
sample is a good starting point.
The controller creates a file entry
from a <code>DataTransferItem</code>
via drag-and-drop.
In this example,
the <code>fileEntry</code> is set
to the first dropped item.
</p>

<pre>
var dnd = new DnDFileController('body', function(data) {
  var fileEntry = data.items[0].webkitGetAsEntry();
  displayPath(fileEntry);
});
</pre>

<h2 id="read">Reading a file</h2>

<p>
The following code opens the file (read-only) and
reads it as text using a <code>FileReader</code> object.
If the file doesn't exist, an error is thrown.
</p>

<pre>
var chosenFileEntry = null;

chooseFileButton.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
  chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry({type: 'openFile'}, function(readOnlyEntry) {
 
    readOnlyEntry.file(function(file) {
      var reader = new FileReader();

      reader.onerror = errorHandler;
      reader.onloadend = function(e) {
        console.log(e.target.result);
      };

      reader.readAsText(file);
    });
	});
});
</pre>

<h2 id="write">Writing a file</h2>

<p>
The two common use-cases
for writing a file are "Save" and "Save as".
The following code creates a
<code>writableEntry</code>
from the read-only <code>chosenFileEntry</code> and
writes the selected file to it.
</p>

<pre>
 chrome.fileSystem.getWritableEntry(chosenFileEntry, function(writableFileEntry) {
    writableFileEntry.createWriter(function(writer) {
      writer.onerror = errorHandler;
      writer.onwriteend = callback;

    chosenFileEntry.file(function(file) {
      writer.write(file);
    });   
  }, errorHandler);
});
</pre>

<p>
The following code creates a new file
with "Save as" functionality and
writes the new blob to the file
using the <code>writer.write()</code> method.
</p>

<pre>
chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry({type: 'saveFile'}, function(writableFileEntry) {
    writableFileEntry.createWriter(function(writer) {
      writer.onerror = errorHandler;
      writer.onwriteend = function(e) {
        console.log('write complete');
      };
      writer.write(new Blob(['1234567890'], {type: 'text/plain'}));  
    }, errorHandler);
});
</pre>
