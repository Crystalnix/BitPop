<h1>Known Issues</h1>

<p>Chrome's support for packaged apps is under active development and rapidly
evolving, so there are still a few rough edges. Here's a list of known issues
in the current <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs/">Chrome
Canary</a>:</p>
{{+partials.known_issues}}
<p>
If one of the above describes an issue you've run into, and you wish to be
updated when it's resolved, click the star icon on the page header. Do not
respond to the bug to say "me too" or ask "when will this be fixed?"; such
updates can cause hundreds of emails to be sent. Add a comment only if you have
information (such as a better test case or a suggested fix) that is likely
to be helpful.

<p>
  If none of the issues listed above describe what you're running into, you
  may wish to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=Feature%3DApps+Type%3DBug">search</a>
  the bug tracker, in case it has been reported but not marked as being known
  yet.
</p>

<p>
  If you still can't find something that matches the problem you're having, you
  can <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Defect report from user&labels=Feature-Apps,Type-Bug,Area-Internals,Pri-2">report
  the bug</a> on the Chromium bug tracker. Please include as many details as
  possible in your bug report, including Chrome version number, operating
  system, and any other relevant configuration details. Bug reports that attach
  a small app that exhibits the problem are especially appreciated.
