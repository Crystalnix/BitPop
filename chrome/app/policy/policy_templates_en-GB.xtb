      A URL has the format 'scheme://host:port/path'.
      The optional scheme can be http, https or ftp. Only this scheme will be blocked; if none is specified, all schemes are blocked.
      The host can be a hostname or an IP address. Sub-domains of a hostname will also be blocked. To prevent blocking sub-domains, include a '.' before the hostname. The special hostname '*' will block all domains.
      The optional port is a valid port number from 1 to 65535. If none is specified, all ports are blocked.
      If the optional path is specified, only paths with that prefix will be blocked.
