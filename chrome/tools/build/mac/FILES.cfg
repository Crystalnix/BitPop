# This is a buildbot configuration file containing a tagged list of files
# processed by the stage/archive scripts. The known tags are:
#
# filename: Name of the file in the build output directory.
# arch:     List of CPU architectures for which this file should be processed
#           (values are based on the strings returned by python's
#           platform.architecture() function).
#           Note: Mac doesn't really care about 'arch' (like Linux does)
#           because binaries are packaged to support multiple architectures,
#           but we still tag the files to allow consistent handling in the
#           buildbot scripts. Tagging them all as both 32bit and 64bit is the
#           safest bet.
# buildtype: List of build types for which this file should be processed.
