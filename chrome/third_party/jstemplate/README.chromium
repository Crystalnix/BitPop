"Template processing that is more suitable for the specific development-time
and runtime requirements of AJAX based web applications.

Specifically, support the case to update a previous template processing
output with an incremental change to the original input data."

Uncalled functions have been removed from util.js to make the resulting
javascript smaller.

compile.py is a simple program used to generate the single compiled jsfile.

NOTE: output is now simply written to stdout so as to allow you to redirect
it to a location required by the shared resource bundle. 

See IDR_SHARED_JS_JSTEMPLATE_COMPILED's file attribute in shared_resources.grd
to determine the correct location for the output.

The jstemplate_compiled.js file which formerly resided in this directory is
no longer used.
