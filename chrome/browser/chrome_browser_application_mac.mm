////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// HISTORICAL COMMENT (by viettrungluu, from
// http://codereview.chromium.org/1520006 with mild editing):
//
// A quick summary of the state of things (before the changes to shutdown):
//
// Currently, we are totally hosed (put in a bad state in which Cmd-W does the
// wrong thing, and which will probably eventually lead to a crash) if we begin
// quitting but termination is aborted for some reason.
//
// I currently know of two ways in which termination can be aborted:
// (1) Common case: a window has an onbeforeunload handler which pops up a
//     "leave web page" dialog, and the user answers "no, don't leave".
// (2) Uncommon case: popups are enabled (in Content Settings, i.e., the popup
//     blocker is disabled), and some nasty web page pops up a new window on
//     closure.
//
// I don't know of other ways in which termination can be aborted, but they may
// exist (or may be added in the future, for that matter).
//
// My CL [see above] does the following:
// a. Should prevent being put in a bad state (which breaks Cmd-W and leads to
//    crash) under all circumstances.
// b. Should completely handle (1) properly.
// c. Doesn't (yet) handle (2) properly and puts it in a weird state (but not
//    that bad).
// d. Any other ways of aborting termination would put it in that weird state.
//
// c. can be fixed by having the global flag reset on browser creation or
// similar (and doing so might also fix some possible d.'s as well). I haven't
// done this yet since I haven't thought about it carefully and since it's a
// corner case.
//
// The weird state: a state in which closing the last window quits the browser.
// This might be a bit annoying, but it's not dangerous in any way.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// |-terminate:| is the entry point for orderly "quit" operations in Cocoa. This
// includes the application menu's quit menu item and keyboard equivalent, the
// application's dock icon menu's quit menu item, "quit" (not "force quit") in
// the Activity Monitor, and quits triggered by user logout and system restart
// and shutdown.
//
// The default |-terminate:| implementation ends the process by calling exit(),
// and thus never leaves the main run loop. This is unsuitable for Chrome since
// Chrome depends on leaving the main run loop to perform an orderly shutdown.
// We support the normal |-terminate:| interface by overriding the default
// implementation. Our implementation, which is very specific to the needs of
// Chrome, works by asking the application delegate to terminate using its
// |-tryToTerminateApplication:| method.
//
// |-tryToTerminateApplication:| differs from the standard
// |-applicationShouldTerminate:| in that no special event loop is run in the
// case that immediate termination is not possible (e.g., if dialog boxes
// allowing the user to cancel have to be shown). Instead, this method sets a
// flag and tries to close all browsers. This flag causes the closure of the
// final browser window to begin actual tear-down of the application.
// Termination is cancelled by resetting this flag. The standard
// |-applicationShouldTerminate:| is not supported, and code paths leading to it
// must be redirected.
