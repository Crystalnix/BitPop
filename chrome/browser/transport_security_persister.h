// TransportSecurityState maintains an in memory database containing the
// list of hosts that currently have transport security enabled. This
// singleton object deals with writing that data out to disk as needed and
// loading it at startup.

// At startup we need to load the transport security state from the
// disk. For the moment, we don't want to delay startup for this load, so we
// let the TransportSecurityState run for a while without being loaded.
// This means that it's possible for pages opened very quickly not to get the
// correct transport security information.
//
// To load the state, we schedule a Task on the file thread which loads,
// deserialises and configures the TransportSecurityState.
//
// The TransportSecurityState object supports running a callback function
// when it changes. This object registers the callback, pointing at itself.
//
// TransportSecurityState calls...
// TransportSecurityPersister::StateIsDirty
//   since the callback isn't allowed to block or reenter, we schedule a Task
//   on the file thread after some small amount of time
//
// ...
//
// TransportSecurityPersister::SerialiseState
//   copies the current state of the TransportSecurityState, serialises
//   and writes to disk.
