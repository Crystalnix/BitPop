// Utilities for testing users of DelayedWorkScheduler. There are no
// thread-safety guarantees for the classes in this file. They expect to
// only be called from the UI thread and issue callbacks on that very same
// thread.
//
// Usage examples:
//
// Making CloudPolicyController and/or DeviceTokenFetcher run without real-time
// delays in tests:
//
//   DeviceTokenFetcher fetcher(..., new DummyDelayedWorkScheduler);
//
// Running CloudPolicyController and/or DeviceTokenFetcher in a simulated
// environment, in which the time of any of their actions can be recorded,
// but without having to wait for the real-time delays:
//
//   EventLogger logger;
//   DeviceTokenFetcher fetcher(..., new LoggingEventScheduler(&logger));
//   CloudPolicyController controller(..., new LoggingEventScheduler(&logger));
//
// Start the policy subsystem, and use logger.RegisterEvent() in case of
// any interesting events. The time of all these events will be recorded
// by |logger|. After that, the results can be extracted easily:
//
//   std::vector<int64> logged_events;
//   logger.Swap(&logged_events);
//
// Each element of |logged_events| corresponds to a logger event, and stores
// the virtual time when it was logged. Events are in ascending order.
