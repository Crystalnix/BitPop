// The DownloadFileManager owns a set of DownloadFile objects, each of which
// represent one in progress download and performs the disk IO for that
// download. The DownloadFileManager itself is a singleton object owned by the
// ResourceDispatcherHost.
//
// The DownloadFileManager uses the file_thread for performing file write
// operations, in order to avoid disk activity on either the IO (network) thread
// and the UI thread. It coordinates the notifications from the network and UI.
//
// A typical download operation involves multiple threads:
//
// Updating an in progress download
// io_thread
//      |----> data ---->|
//                     file_thread (writes to disk)
//                              |----> stats ---->|
//                                              ui_thread (feedback for user and
//                                                         updates to history)
//
// Cancel operations perform the inverse order when triggered by a user action:
// ui_thread (user click)
//    |----> cancel command ---->|
//                          file_thread (close file)
//                                 |----> cancel command ---->|
//                                                    io_thread (stops net IO
//                                                               for download)
//
// The DownloadFileManager tracks download requests, mapping from a download
// ID (unique integer created in the IO thread) to the DownloadManager for the
// tab (profile) where the download was initiated. In the event of a tab closure
// during a download, the DownloadFileManager will continue to route data to the
// appropriate DownloadManager. In progress downloads are cancelled for a
// DownloadManager that exits (such as when closing a profile).
