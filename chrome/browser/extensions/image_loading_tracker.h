// alive while the request is in progress (manages its own lifetime) and keeps
// track of whether the view still cares about the icon loading.
//
// To use this class, have your class derive from ImageLoadingTracker::Observer,
// and add a member variable ImageLoadingTracker tracker_. Then override
// Observer::OnImageLoaded and call:
//   tracker_.LoadImage(extension, resource, max_size, false);
// ... and wait for OnImageLoaded to be called back on you with a pointer to the
// SkBitmap loaded.
// NOTE: if the image is available already (or the resource is not valid), the
// Observer is notified immediately from the call to LoadImage. In other words,
// by the time LoadImage returns the observer has been notified.
