// On OS X, the mach_port_t of a process is required to collect metrics about
// the process. Running |task_for_pid()| is only allowed for privileged code.
// However, a process has port rights to all its subprocesses, so let the
// browser's child processes send their Mach port to the browser over IPC.
// This way, the brower can at least collect metrics of its child processes,
// which is what it's most interested in anyway.
//
// Mach ports can only be sent over Mach IPC, not over the |socketpair()| that
// the regular IPC system uses. Hence, the child processes open a Mach
// connection shortly after launching and ipc their mach data to the browser
// process. This data is kept in a global |MachBroker| object.
//
// Since this data arrives over a separate channel, it is not available
// immediately after a child process has been started.
