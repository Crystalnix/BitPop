// This class is used for live experiment of network connectivity (either TCP or
// UDP) metrics. A small percentage of users participate in this experiment. All
// users (who are in the experiment) must have enabled "UMA upload".
//
// This class collects the following stats from users who have opted in.
// a) What percentage of users can get a message end-to-end to a UDP server?
// b) What percentage of users can get a message end-to-end to a TCP server?
// c) What is the latency for UDP and TCP.
// d) If connectivity failed, at what stage (Connect or Write or Read) did it
// fail?
//
// The following is the overview of the echo message protocol.
//
// We send the "echo request" to the TCP/UDP servers in the following format:
// <version><checksum><payload_size><payload>. <version> is the version number
// of the "echo request". <checksum> is the checksum of the <payload>.
// <payload_size> specifies the number of bytes in the <payload>.
//
// TCP/UDP servers respond to the "echo request" by returning "echo response".
// "echo response" is of the format:
// "<version><checksum><payload_size><key><encoded_payload>". <payload_size>
// specifies the number of bytes in the <encoded_payload>. <key> is used to
// decode the <encoded_payload>.
