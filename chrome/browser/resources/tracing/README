This directory contains the UI for Chrome's about:tracing tool.

To work on this code:
  cd src/chrome/browser/resources/
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

In any browser, navigate to
  http://localhost:8000/tracing/

We use Closure's unit test harness for testing. There isn't a master
test file, so just run all the .html files you find. :/

If you add a file, make sure to update ../tracing.js and verify all the tests,
since we don't have a sane module system.
