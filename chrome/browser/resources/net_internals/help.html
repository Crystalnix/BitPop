<h2>How to get data for bug reports</h2>

<ol>
<li>Reproduce the network problem.</li>
<li>Click the <i>Dump to file</i> button in the <i>Export</i> tab.</li>

<li>The log file will act like a normal download.</li>

<li>Email this log file to the bug investigator,
  <b>along with an explanation of what went wrong, including any relevant
     URLs.</b>
  You may want to compress the file before sending, as the log files can be
  fairly large but compress well.
</li>

</ol>


<ul>
<li>The network log <b>may contain personally identifying information</b> like
  IP addresses, URLs, and cookies.</li>
<ul>
<li>You can edit the log to obscure information if you like, but sometimes it
  is relevant to the bug.  If you choose do this, please make sure you can still
  load the log file.</li>
<li>If you choose not to have cookies removed from the log, you must toggle
  the checkbox before clicking the button.</li>
</ul>
<li>Ideally you would have the tool running <b>before</b> you reproduce the
  bug.
  If that isn't possible (perhaps the bug happens unpredictably), then the
  next best thing is to load chrome://net-internals/ <b>as soon as you can
  after</b> the problem has occurred.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<ul>
  <li>While the net-internals page is open, it will capture the network events
  that are happening in Chrome. You can view that in real-time by going to
  the <i>Events</i> tab.</li>
  <li>Once you close the net-internals window, the data it had captured will be
  discarded.</li>
<li>Chrome keeps around a small buffer of the most recent network events
  even when the net-internals window is not open. That way if you open
  chrome://net-internals/ <b>shortly after</b> encountering a problem,
  you may still find the relevant data.
  These <i>passively captured</i> events are less accurate however, and will
  be prefixed in the log with <span style="font-family: monospace;">(P)</span>.
</li>
</ul>
