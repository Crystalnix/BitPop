    This test runs a simple looped computation to test basic
    functionality of profile view grid.
    <br>
    <br>
    To use this test:
    <ul>
      <li>load file in the browser;
      <li>open DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+I on Win/Linux, Command+Option+I on Mac);
      <li>go to 'Profiles' page;
      <li>press 'Start profiling' button
        (gray dot on the left side of status bar);
      <li>wait for 5 seconds;
      <li>press 'Stop profiling' button
        (red dot on the left side of status bar);
    </ul>
    <br>
    On the left pane under 'CPU profiles' section, an item called
    'Profile 1' must appear, and a grid with profile data must
    appear on the right. Now test the following functionality in the grid:
    <ul>
      <li>change sorting order in each column by clicking on its header;
      <li>resize each column;
      <li>toggle between showing absolute times and percents
        (button with percent sign on the status bar);
      <li>double-click on numbers in 'Self' and
        'Total' columns to toggle between times and percents for
        this column only;
      <li>expanding and collapsing tree nodes;
      <li>toggling between "Heavy" and "Tree" views.
    </ul>
