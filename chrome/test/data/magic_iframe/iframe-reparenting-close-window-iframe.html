// Timeout explanation:
// To reproduce the issue, I need the XHR to start but not finish until the
// iframe transfer is complete. If I just navigate to some file, the load
// actually happens before the iframe is transferred and all the
// onreadystatechange notifications are already queued and just fire in the new
// page.
// The bug, however, deals with XHR being still in progress in the browser
// process, so when it is done and comes back with the routing_id of the closed
// window, it has no way of finding the original iframe and firing
// onreadystatechange. Because of this timeout the test can occasionally produce
// false positive (if the reparenting takes longer then 1 second for example),
// however this is very unlikely, and it won't make test flakey
// (which is usually a false negative).
