"""Performance test for HTML5 media tag.

This PyAuto powered script plays media (video or audio) files using the HTML5
tag embedded in an HTML file (specified in the GetPlayerHTMLFileName() method)
and measures CPU and memory usage using the psutil library in a different
thread using the UIPerfTestMeasureThread class. The parameters needed to
run this test are passed in the form of environment variables
(such as the number of runs). media_perf_runner.py is used for
generating these variables (PyAuto does not support direct parameters).
