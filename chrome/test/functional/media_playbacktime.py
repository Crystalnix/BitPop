"""Simple test for HTML5 media tag to measure playback time.

This PyAuto powered script plays media (video or audio) files using the HTML5
tag embedded in an HTML file (specified in the GetPlayerHTMLFileName() method)
and measures simple playback time. The parameters needed to run this test are
passed in the form of environment variables (such as the number of runs).
media_perf_runner.py is used for generating these variables
(PyAuto does not support direct parameters).
