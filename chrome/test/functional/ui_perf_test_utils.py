"""Module for performance testing using the psutil library.

Ref: http://code.google.com/p/psutil/wiki/Documentation

Most part of this module is from chrome/test/startup/startup_test.cc and
chrome/test/ui/ui_perf_test.[h,cc] So, we try to preserve the original C++ code
here in case when there is change in original C++ code, it is easy to update
this.
