// Channels are implemented using named pipes on Windows, and
// socket pairs (or in some special cases unix domain sockets) on POSIX.
// On Windows we access pipes in various processes by name.
// On POSIX we pass file descriptors to child processes and assign names to them
// in a lookup table.
// In general on POSIX we do not use unix domain sockets due to security
// concerns and the fact that they can leave garbage around the file system
// (MacOS does not support abstract named unix domain sockets).
// You can use unix domain sockets if you like on POSIX by constructing the
// the channel with the mode set to one of the NAMED modes. NAMED modes are
// currently used by automation and service processes.
