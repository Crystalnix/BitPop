  NOTIFICATION_CONTENT_START = 0,

  // General -----------------------------------------------------------------

  // Special signal value to represent an interest in all notifications.
  // Not valid when posting a notification.
  NOTIFICATION_ALL = NOTIFICATION_CONTENT_START,

  // The app is done processing user actions, now is a good time to do
  // some background work.
  NOTIFICATION_IDLE,

  // Means that the app has just started doing something in response to a
  // user action, and that background processes shouldn't run if avoidable.
  NOTIFICATION_BUSY,

  // This is sent when the user does a gesture resulting in a noteworthy
  // action taking place. This is typically used for logging. The source is
  // the browser context, and the details is a string identifying the action.
  NOTIFICATION_USER_ACTION,

  // NavigationController ----------------------------------------------------

  // A new pending navigation has been created. Pending entries are created
  // when the user requests the navigation. We don't know if it will actually
  // happen until it does (at this point, it will be "committed." Note that
  // renderer- initiated navigations such as link clicks will never be
  // pending.
  //
  // This notification is called after the pending entry is created, but
  // before we actually try to navigate. The source will be the
  // NavigationController that owns the pending entry, and the details
  // will be a NavigationEntry.
  NOTIFICATION_NAV_ENTRY_PENDING,

  // A new non-pending navigation entry has been created. This will
  // correspond to one NavigationController entry being created (in the case
  // of new navigations) or renavigated to (for back/forward navigations).
  //
  // The source will be the navigation controller doing the commit. The
  // details will be NavigationController::LoadCommittedDetails.
  NOTIFICATION_NAV_ENTRY_COMMITTED,

  // Indicates that the NavigationController given in the Source has
  // decreased its back/forward list count by removing entries from either
  // the front or back of its list. This is usually the result of going back
  // and then doing a new navigation, meaning all the "forward" items are
  // deleted.
  //
  // This normally happens as a result of a new navigation. It will be
  // followed by a NAV_ENTRY_COMMITTED message for the new page that
  // caused the pruning. It could also be a result of removing an item from
  // the list to fix up after interstitials.
  //
  // The details are NavigationController::PrunedDetails.
  NOTIFICATION_NAV_LIST_PRUNED,

  // Indicates that a NavigationEntry has changed. The source will be the
  // NavigationController that owns the NavigationEntry. The details will be
  // a NavigationController::EntryChangedDetails struct.
  //
  // This will NOT be sent on navigation, interested parties should also
  // listen for NAV_ENTRY_COMMITTED to handle that case. This will be
  // sent when the entry is updated outside of navigation (like when a new
  // title comes).
  NOTIFICATION_NAV_ENTRY_CHANGED,

  // Other load-related (not from NavigationController) ----------------------

  // Corresponds to ViewHostMsg_DocumentOnLoadCompletedInMainFrame. The source
  // is the WebContents and the details the page_id.
  NOTIFICATION_LOAD_COMPLETED_MAIN_FRAME,

  // A content load is starting.  The source will be a
  // Source<NavigationController> corresponding to the tab in which the load
  // is occurring.  No details are expected for this notification.
  NOTIFICATION_LOAD_START,

  // A content load has stopped. The source will be a
  // Source<NavigationController> corresponding to the tab in which the load
  // is occurring.  Details in the form of a LoadNotificationDetails object
  // are optional.
  NOTIFICATION_LOAD_STOP,

  // Content was loaded from an in-memory cache.  The source will be a
  // Source<NavigationController> corresponding to the tab in which the load
  // occurred.  Details in the form of a LoadFromMemoryCacheDetails object
  // are provided.
  NOTIFICATION_LOAD_FROM_MEMORY_CACHE,

  // A provisional content load has failed with an error.  The source will be
  // a Source<NavigationController> corresponding to the tab in which the
  // load occurred.  Details in the form of a ProvisionalLoadDetails object
  // are provided.
  NOTIFICATION_FAIL_PROVISIONAL_LOAD_WITH_ERROR,

  // A response has been received for a resource request.  The source will be
  // a Source<WebContents> corresponding to the tab in which the request was
  // issued.  Details in the form of a ResourceRequestDetails object are
  // provided.
  NOTIFICATION_RESOURCE_RESPONSE_STARTED,

  // A redirect was received while requesting a resource.  The source will be
  // a Source<WebContents> corresponding to the tab in which the request was
  // issued.  Details in the form of a ResourceRedirectDetails are provided.
  NOTIFICATION_RESOURCE_RECEIVED_REDIRECT,

  // SSL ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  // Updating the SSL security indicators (the lock icon and such) proceeds
  // in two phases:
  //
  // 1) The internal SSL state for a host or tab changes.  When this happens,
  //    the SSLManager broadcasts an SSL_INTERNAL_STATE_CHANGED notification.
  //
  // 2) The SSLManager for each tab receives this notification and might or
  //    might not update the navigation entry for its tab, depending on
  //    whether the change in state affects that tab.  If the SSLManager does
  //    change the navigation entry, then the SSLManager broadcasts an
  //    SSL_VISIBLE_STATE_CHANGED notification to the user interface can
  //    redraw properly.

  // The SSL state of a page has changed in some visible way.  For example,
  // if an insecure resource is loaded on a secure page.  Note that a
  // toplevel load commit will also update the SSL state (since the
  // NavigationEntry is new) and this message won't always be sent in that
  // case.  Listen to this notification if you need to refresh SSL-related UI
  // elements.
  //
  // There is no source or details.
  NOTIFICATION_SSL_VISIBLE_STATE_CHANGED,

  // The SSL state of the browser has changed in some internal way.  For
  // example, the user might have explicitly allowed some broken certificate
  // or a secure origin might have included some insecure content.  Listen to
  // this notifiation if you need to keep track of our internal SSL state.
  //
  // The source will be the browser context. The details will be the navigation
  // controller associated with the state change.
  NOTIFICATION_SSL_INTERNAL_STATE_CHANGED,

  // The user accepted or dismissed a SSL client authentication request.
  // The source is a Source<SSLClientAuthHandler>.  Details is a
  // SSLClientAuthNotificationDetails which records specifies which

  // selected (if any).

  // are provided.
  NOTIFICATION_NO_KEY_WINDOW,
#endif

  // This is sent when the user has chosen to exit the app, but before any
  // browsers have closed. This is sent if the user chooses to exit
  // (via exit menu item or keyboard shortcut) or to restart the process
  // (such as in flags page), not if Chrome exists by some other means
  // (such as the user closing the last window). Note that receiving this
  // notification does not necessarily mean the process will exit
