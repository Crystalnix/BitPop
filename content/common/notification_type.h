// This file describes various types used to describe and filter notifications
// that pass through the NotificationService.
//
// It is written as an enum inside a class so that it can be forward declared.
// You're not allowed to forward declare an enum, and we want to forward
// declare this since it's required by NotificationObserver which is included
// by a lot of header files.
//
// Since this class encapsulates an integral value, it should be passed by
// value.
class NotificationType {
 public:
  enum Type {
    // General -----------------------------------------------------------------

    // Special signal value to represent an interest in all notifications.
    // Not valid when posting a notification.
    ALL = 0,

    // The app is done processing user actions, now is a good time to do
    // some background work.
    IDLE,

    // Means that the app has just started doing something in response to a
    // user action, and that background processes shouldn't run if avoidable.
    BUSY,

    // This is sent when the user does a gesture resulting in a noteworthy
    // action taking place. This is typically used for logging. The source is
    // the profile, and the details is a string identifying the action.
    USER_ACTION,

    // NavigationController ----------------------------------------------------

    // A new pending navigation has been created. Pending entries are created
    // when the user requests the navigation. We don't know if it will actually
    // happen until it does (at this point, it will be "committed." Note that
    // renderer- initiated navigations such as link clicks will never be
    // pending.
    //
    // This notification is called after the pending entry is created, but
    // before we actually try to navigate. The source will be the
    // NavigationController that owns the pending entry, and there are no
    // details.
    NAV_ENTRY_PENDING,

    // A new non-pending navigation entry has been created. This will
    // correspond to one NavigationController entry being created (in the case
    // of new navigations) or renavigated to (for back/forward navigations).
    //
    // The source will be the navigation controller doing the commit. The
    // details will be NavigationController::LoadCommittedDetails.
    NAV_ENTRY_COMMITTED,

    // Indicates that the NavigationController given in the Source has
    // decreased its back/forward list count by removing entries from either
    // the front or back of its list. This is usually the result of going back
    // and then doing a new navigation, meaning all the "forward" items are
    // deleted.
    //
    // This normally happens as a result of a new navigation. It will be
    // followed by a NAV_ENTRY_COMMITTED message for the new page that
    // caused the pruning. It could also be a result of removing an item from
    // the list to fix up after interstitials.
    //
    // The details are NavigationController::PrunedDetails.
    NAV_LIST_PRUNED,

    // Indicates that a NavigationEntry has changed. The source will be the
    // NavigationController that owns the NavigationEntry. The details will be
    // a NavigationController::EntryChangedDetails struct.
    //
    // This will NOT be sent on navigation, interested parties should also
    // listen for NAV_ENTRY_COMMITTED to handle that case. This will be
    // sent when the entry is updated outside of navigation (like when a new
    // title comes).
    NAV_ENTRY_CHANGED,

    // Other load-related (not from NavigationController) ----------------------

    // Corresponds to ViewHostMsg_DocumentOnLoadCompletedInMainFrame. The source
    // is the TabContents and the details the page_id.
    LOAD_COMPLETED_MAIN_FRAME,

    // are optional.
    LOAD_STOP,

    // Content was loaded from an in-memory cache.  The source will be a
    // Source<NavigationController> corresponding to the tab in which the load
    // occurred.  Details in the form of a LoadFromMemoryCacheDetails object
    // are provided.
    LOAD_FROM_MEMORY_CACHE,

    // A provisional content load has failed with an error.  The source will be
    // a Source<NavigationController> corresponding to the tab in which the
    // load occurred.  Details in the form of a ProvisionalLoadDetails object
    // are provided.
    FAIL_PROVISIONAL_LOAD_WITH_ERROR,

    // A response has been received for a resource request.  The source will be
    // a Source<RenderViewHostDelegate> corresponding to the tab in which the
    // request was issued.  Details in the form of a ResourceRequestDetails
    // object are provided.
    RESOURCE_RESPONSE_STARTED,

    // A redirect was received while requesting a resource.  The source will be

    // SSL ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    // Updating the SSL security indicators (the lock icon and such) proceeds
    // in two phases:
    //
    // 1) The internal SSL state for a host or tab changes.  When this happens,
    //    the SSLManager broadcasts an SSL_INTERNAL_STATE_CHANGED notification.
    //
    // 2) The SSLManager for each tab receives this notification and might or
    //    might not update the navigation entry for its tab, depending on
    //    whether the change in state affects that tab.  If the SSLManager does
    //    change the navigation entry, then the SSLManager broadcasts an
    //    SSL_VISIBLE_STATE_CHANGED notification to the user interface can
    //    redraw properly.

    // The SSL state of a page has changed in some visible way.  For example,
    // if an insecure resource is loaded on a secure page.  Note that a
    // toplevel load commit will also update the SSL state (since the
    // NavigationEntry is new) and this message won't always be sent in that
    // case.  Listen to this notification if you need to refresh SSL-related UI
    // elements.
    //
    // There is no source or details.
    SSL_VISIBLE_STATE_CHANGED,

    // The source will be the navigation controller associated with the state
    // change.  There are no details.
    SSL_INTERNAL_STATE_CHANGED,

    // The user accepted or dismissed a SSL client authentication request.
