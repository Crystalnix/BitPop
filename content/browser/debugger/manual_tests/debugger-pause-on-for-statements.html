<script>
function test()
{
    debugger;
}

for (var i = 0; i < 1; ++i)
    test();
</script>

<p>To test, open the DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+I) and reload the page. When the debugger breaks, select the
(anonymous function) node in the call stack, you should see the execution line on the call to test().</p>
<br><br>
Also set a breakpoint on the call to test(), and reload. It should break before the test() function is called.
