<p>To test, open the DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+I) and reload the page.
<br><br>
Before running the tests please perform the following:
Make sure the execution is not paused in the debugger.<br>
Click the button and when the debugger breaks, set a breakpoint on the first line in the loop
(as indicated by the comment), and click continue.<br>
The debugger should stop at the beggining of the loop.<br>
The above actions should be performed before <b>each</b> of the following tests.</p>
<br><br>
<input type="button" value="run do-while" onclick="initialize();runDoWhile()"/>
<br><br>
TEST 1: Click 'continue'. Execution should continue without stopping on the loop breakpoint again.<br>
TEST 2: Click 'Step into'. Debugger should step inside each function.<br>
TEST 3: 'Step over' to the end of the loop (and 'while' statement) and step over again. Debugger
should go to the beggining of the loop.<br>
