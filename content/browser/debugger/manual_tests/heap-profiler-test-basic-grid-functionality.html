  </head>
  <body>
    This is the test for basic functionality of heap snapshot view grid.
    <br>
    <br>
    To use this test:
    <ul>
      <li>load file in the browser;
      <li>open DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+I on Win/Linux, Command+Option+I on Mac);
      <li>go to 'Profiles' page;
      <li>press 'Take heap snapshot' button
        (eye icon on the left side of status bar);
    </ul>
    <br>
    On the left pane under 'Heap snapshots' section, an item called
    'Snapshot 1' must appear, and a grid with snapshot data must
    appear on the right. Now test the following functionality in the grid:
    <ul>
      <li>change sorting order in each column by clicking on its header;
      <li>resize each column;
      <li>toggle between showing absolute times and percents
        (button with percent sign on the status bar);
      <li>double-click on numbers in 'Count' and
        'Size' columns to toggle between times and percents for
        this column only;
      <li>expanding and collapsing tree nodes.
    </ul>
