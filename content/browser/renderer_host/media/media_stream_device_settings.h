// MediaStreamDeviceSettings is used to decide which of the available capture
// device to use as well as getting user permission to use the capture device.
// There will be one instance of MediaStreamDeviceSettings handling all
// requests.

// Expected call flow:
// 1. RequestCaptureDeviceUsage() is called to create a new request for capture
//    device usage.
// 2. AvailableDevices() is called with a list of currently available devices.
// 3. Pick device and get user confirmation.
// 4. Confirm by calling SettingsRequester::DevicesAccepted().
// Repeat step 1 - 4 for new device requests.
