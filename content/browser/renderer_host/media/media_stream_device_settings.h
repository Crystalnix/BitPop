// MediaStreamDeviceSettings is used to decide which of the available capture
// device to use as well as getting user permission to use the capture device.
// There will be one instance of MediaStreamDeviceSettings handling all
// requests.

// This version always accepts the first device in the list(s), but this will
// soon be changed to ask the user and/or Chrome settings.

// Expected call flow:
// 1. RequestCaptureDeviceUsage() to request usage of capture device.
// 2. SettingsRequester::GetDevices() is called to get a list of available
//    devices.
// 3. AvailableDevices() is called with a list of currently available devices.
// 4. TODO(mflodman) Pick device and get user confirmation.
// Temporary 4. Choose first device of each requested media type.
// 5. Confirm by calling SettingsRequester::DevicesAccepted().
// Repeat step 1 - 5 for new device requests.

// Note that this is still in a development phase and the class will be modified
// to include real UI interaction.
