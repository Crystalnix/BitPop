// The "GPU plugin" is currently implemented as a special kind of
// NPAPI plugin to provide high-performance on-screen 3D rendering for
// Pepper 3D.
//
// On Windows and X11 platforms the GPU plugin relies on cross-process
// parenting of windows, which is not supported via any public APIs in
// the Mac OS X window system.
//
// To achieve full hardware acceleration we use the new IOSurface APIs
// introduced in Mac OS X 10.6. The GPU plugin's process produces an
// IOSurface and renders into it using OpenGL. It uses the
// IOSurfaceGetID and IOSurfaceLookup APIs to pass a reference to this
// surface to the browser process for on-screen rendering. The GPU
// plugin essentially looks like a windowless plugin; the browser
// process gets all of the mouse events, because the plugin process
// does not have an on-screen window.
//
// This class encapsulates some of the management of these data
// structures, in conjunction with the AcceleratedSurfaceContainerManagerMac.
