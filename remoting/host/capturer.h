// A class to perform the task of capturing the image of a window.
// The capture action is asynchronous to allow maximum throughput.
//
// The full capture process is as follows:
//
// (1) InvalidateRects
//     This is an optional step where regions of the screen are marked as
//     invalid. Some platforms (Windows, for now) won't use this and will
//     instead calculate the diff-regions later (in step (2). Other
//     platforms (Mac) will use this to mark all the changed regions of the
//     screen. Some limited rect-merging (e.g., to eliminate exact
//     duplicates) may be done here.
//
// (2) CaptureInvalidRects
//     This is where the bits for the invalid rects are packaged up and sent
//     to the encoder.
//     A screen capture is performed if needed. For example, Windows requires
//     a capture to calculate the diff from the previous screen, whereas the
//     Mac version does not.
//
// Implementation has to ensure the following guarantees:
// 1. Double buffering
//    Since data can be read while another capture action is happening.
