// |TrackedCallback| represents a tracked Pepper callback (from the browser to
// the plugin), typically still pending. Such callbacks have the standard Pepper
// callback semantics. Execution (i.e., completion) of callbacks happens through
// objects of subclasses of |TrackedCallback|. Two things are ensured: (1) that
// the callback is executed at most once, and (2) once a callback is marked to
// be aborted, any subsequent completion is abortive (even if a non-abortive
// completion had previously been scheduled).
//
// The details of non-abortive completion depend on the type of callback (e.g.,
// different parameters may be required), but basic abort functionality is core.
// The ability to post aborts is needed in many situations to ensure that the
// plugin is not re-entered into. (Note that posting a task to just run
// |Abort()| is different and not correct; calling |PostAbort()| additionally
// guarantees that all subsequent completions will be abortive.)
//
// This class is reference counted so that different things can hang on to it,
// and not worry too much about ensuring Pepper callback semantics. Note that
// the "owning" |CallbackTracker| will keep a reference until the callback is
// completed.
//
// Subclasses must do several things:
//  - They must ensure that the callback is executed at most once (by looking at
//    |completed()| before running the callback).
//  - They must ensure that the callback is run abortively if it is marked as to
//    be aborted (by looking at |aborted()| before running the callback).
//  - They must call |MarkAsCompleted()| immediately before actually running the
//    callback; see the comment for |MarkAsCompleted()| for a caveat.
