  // This function should not generally be necessary for normal plugin
  // operation. If you want to update portions of a device, the expectation is
  // that you will either regenerate the data, or maintain a backing store
  // pushing updates to the device from your backing store via PaintImageData.
  // Using this function will introduce an extra copy which will make your
  // plugin slower. In some cases, this may be a very expensive operation (it
  // may require slow cross-process transitions or graphics card readbacks).
  //
  // Data will be read into the image starting at |top_left| in the device
  // context, and proceeding down and to the right for as many pixels as the
  // image is large. If any part of the image bound would fall outside of the
  // backing store of the device if positioned at |top_left|, this function
  // will fail and return PP_FALSE.
  //
  // The image format must be of the format
  // PPB_ImageData.GetNativeImageDataFormat() or this function will fail and
  // return PP_FALSE.
  //
  // The returned image data will represent the current status of the backing
  // store. This will not include any paint, scroll, or replace operations
  // that have not yet been flushed; these operations are only reflected in
  // the backing store (and hence ReadImageData) until after a Flush()
  // operation has completed.

  // issue some asynchronous call that has a callback. Then you call

  // messages, giving the asynchronous operation time to complete. In your
  // callback, you save the data and call QuitMessageLoop, which will then
  // pop back up and continue with the test. This avoids having to write a
