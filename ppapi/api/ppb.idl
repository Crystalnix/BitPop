/* This function pointer type defines the signature for the PPB_GetInterface
 * function. A generic PPB_GetInterface pointer is passed to
 * PPP_InitializedModule when your module is loaded. You can use this pointer
 * to request a pointer to a specific browser interface. Browser interface
 * names are ASCII strings and are generally defined in the header file for
 * the interface, such as PP_AUDIO_INTERFACE found in ppb.audio.h or
 * PPB_GRAPHICS_2D_INTERFACE in ppb_graphics_2d.h.
 *
 * This value will be NULL if the interface is not supported on the browser.
