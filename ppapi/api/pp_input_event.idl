 *
 * If the user loses focus on the module while a key is down, a key up
 * event might not occur. For example, if the module has focus and the user
 * presses and holds the shift key, the module will see a "shift down" message.
 * Then if the user clicks elsewhere on the web page, the module's focus will
 * be lost and no more input events will be delivered.

 * If your module depends on receiving key up events, it should also handle
 * "lost focus" as the equivalent of "all keys up."

 * a '%'. The key down and up events will give you the scan code for the "5"
 * key, and the character event will give you the '%' character.
 *
 * You may not get a character event for all key down events if the key doesn't
 * generate a character. Likewise, you may actually get multiple character
 * events in a row. For example, some locales have an accent key that modifies
 * the next character typed. You might get this stream of events: accent down,
 * accent up (it didn't generate a character), letter key down, letter with
 * accent character event (it was modified by the previous accent key), letter
 * key up.  If the letter can't be combined with the accent, like an umlaut and
 * an 'R', the system might send unlaut down, umlaut up, 'R' key down, umlaut
 * character (can't combine it with 'R', so just send the raw unlaut so it
