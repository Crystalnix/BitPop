/* A PP_TimeTicks value represents time ticks which are measured in seconds
 * and are used for indicating the time that certain messages were received.
 * In contrast to PP_Time, PP_TimeTicks does not correspond to any actual
 * wall clock time and will not change discontinuously if the user changes
 * their computer clock.
 *
 * The units are in seconds, but are not measured relative to any particular
 * epoch, so the most you can do is compare two values.
