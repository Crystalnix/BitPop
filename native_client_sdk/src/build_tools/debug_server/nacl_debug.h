/*
 * This module provides a 'C' style interface to the NaCl debugging
 * related functions, and drives the C++ debugging stub.  The functions
 * defined here are safe to call, because they always check if debugging
 * is enabled and catch all exceptions throws by underlying C++ libraries.
 * For this reason, the debug stub library should not be called directly.
 *
 * The behavior of the debug stub is controlled through a combination of
 * a set of environment (described bellow), and conditional compilation
 * based on definition of _DEBUG.
 *
 * These functions are non-reentrant except for the functions notifying
 * the debug stub that thread has been created or is about to be
 * destroyed.  It is expected the other functions will all be called by
 * the main thread.
