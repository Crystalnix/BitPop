// This module provides interfaces for accessing the debugging state of
// the target.  The target can use either the thread that took the
// exception or run in it's own thread.  To respond to the host, the
// application must call the run function with a valid Transport
// which will then be polled for commands.  The target will return
// from Run when the host disconnects, or requests a continue.
//
// The object is protected by a mutex, so that it is legal to track or
// ignore threads as an exception takes place.
//
// The Run function expects that all threads of interest are stopped
// with the Step flag cleared before Run is called.  It is expected that
// and that all threads are updated with thier modified contexts and
// restarted when the target returns from Run.
