//  This module provides an object for handling RSP responsibilities of
//  the host side of the connection.  The host behaves like a cache, and
//  is responsible for syncronization of state between the Target and Host.
//  For example, the Host is responsible for updating the thread context
//  before restarting the Target, and for updating it's internal array of
//  threads whenever the Target stops.
