<title>Native Client Examples</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Native Client Examples</h1>
<dd><p>This page lists all of the examples available in the most recent Native
 Client SDK bundle. Each example is designed to teach a few specific Native
 Client programming concepts.  You will need to setup the build environment
 including a path to 'make' which can be found in the 'tools' directory for
 Windows, and the variable NACL_SDK_ROOT which points to one of the pepper
 bundles found under the SDK install location.  Calling make from the examples
 directory will build all the projects, while calling make from and individual
 example directory will build only that example.
 </p>
</dd>
<h3>Using the Tools</h3>
<dd><p>The following "hello_world" examples, show the basic outline of a Native
Client application.  The make files in each of the examples bellow show a
simple way to build a NaCl application using
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU Make</a>.
See the link for further information.
</p></dd>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="hello_world/index.html">Hello World</a></dt>
  <dd>The Hello World In C example demonstrates the basic structure of all
  Native Client applications. This example loads a Native Client module.  The
  page tracks the status of the module as it load.  On a successful load, the
  module will post a message containing the string "Hello World" back to
  JavaScript which will display it as an alert.
  <p>Teaching focus: Basic HTML, JavaScript, and module architecture.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="hello_world_interactive/index.html">
  Interactive Hello World in C++</a></dt>
  <dd>The Interactive Hello World C++ example demonstrates the basic structure
  of all Native Client applications. This example loads a Native Client module
  which uses two way interaction with JavaScript whenever a button is clicked.
  The NaCl module will respond with the number 42 or the reversed version of the
  string in the text box when the appropriate button is clicked.
  <p>Teaching focus: Basic HTML, JavaScript, C++ PPAPI, and module
    architecture; Messaging API.</p>
  </dd>

<h3>Common APIs</h3>
<dd><p>The following set of examples illustrate various Pepper APIs including
audio, 2D, 3D, file I/O, input and urls.</p></dd>
  <dt><a href="sine_synth/index.html">Sine Wave Synthesizer</a></dt>
  <dd>  The Sine Wave Synthesizer example demonstrates playing sound (a sine
  wave).  Enter the desired frequency and hit play to start, stop to end. The
  frequency box will display "Loading, please wait." while the module loads.
    <p>Teaching focus: Audio.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="input_events/index.html">Input Events</a></dt>
  <dd>  The Input Events example demonstrates how to handle events triggered by
  the user. This example allows a user to interact with a square representing a
  module instance. Events are displayed on the screen as the user clicks,
  scrolls, types, inside or outside of the square.
  <p>Teaching focus: Keyboard and mouse input, view change, and focus events.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="pi_generator/index.html">Pi Generator</a></dt>
  <dd>	The Pi Generator example demonstrates creating a helper thread that
  estimate pi using the Monte Carlo method while randomly putting 1,000,000,000
  points inside a 2D square that shares two sides with a quarter circle.
  <p>Teaching focus: Thread creation, 2D graphics, view change events.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="tumbler/index.html">Tumbler</a></dt>
  <dd>  The Tumbler example demonstrates how to create a 3D cube that you can
  rotate with your mouse while pressing the left mouse button. This example
  creates a 3D context and draws to it using OpenGL ES. The JavaScript
  implements a virtual trackball interface to map mouse movements into 3D
  rotations using simple 3D vector math and quaternions.
  <p>Teaching focus: 3D graphics</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="hello_world_gles/index.html">Hello World GLES 2.0</a></dt>
  <dd>  The Hello World GLES 2.0 example demonstrates how to create a 3D cube
  that rotates.  This is a simpler example than the tumbler example, and
  written in C.  It loads the assets using URLLoader.
  <p>Teaching focus: 3D graphics, URL Loader</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="geturl/index.html">Get URL</a></dt>
  <dd>  The Get URL example demonstrates fetching an URL and then displaying
  its contents.
  <p>Teaching focus: URL loading.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="file_io/index.html">File I/O</a></dt>
  <dd>  The File IO example demonstrates saving, loading, and deleting files
  from the persistent file store.

    <p>Teaching focus: File input and output.</p>
  </dd>

<h3>Common Concepts</h3>
<dd><p>The following set of examples illustrate various common concepts such as
showing load progress, using Shared Objects (dynamic libraries),
mulithreading...</p></dd>
<dt><a href="dlopen/index.html">Dynamic Library Open (GLIBC)</a></dt>
  <dd>  The dlopen example demonstrates how build dynamic libraries and then
  open and use them at runtime.  When the page loads, type in a question and
  hit enter or click the ASK! button.  The question and answer will be
  displayed in the page under the text entry box.
    <p>Teaching focus: Using shared objects.</p>
  </dd>
<dt><a href="load_progress/index.html">Load Progress</a></dt>
  <dd>  The Load Progress example demonstrates how to listen for and handle
  events that occur while a NaCl module loads.  This example listens for
  different load event types and dispatches different events to their
  respective handler. This example also checks for valid browser version and
  shows how to calculate and display loading progress.

    <p>Teaching focus: Progress event handling.</p>
  </dd>
<dt><a href="pong/index.html">Pong</a></dt>
  <dd>	The Pong example demonstrates how to create a basic 2D video game and
  how to store application information in a local persistent file. This game
  uses up and down arrow keyboard input events to move the paddle.

    <p>Teaching focus: File I/O, 2D graphics, input events.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="mt_input_events/index.html">Multi-threaded
  Input Events</a></dt>
  <dd>The Multithreaded Input Events example combines HTML, Javascript,
    and C++ (the C++ is compiled to create a .nexe file).
    The C++ shows how to handle input events in a multi-threaded application.
    The main thread converts input events to non-pepper events and puts them on
    a queue. The worker thread pulls them off of the queue, converts them to a
    string, and then uses CallOnMainThread so that PostMessage can be send the
    result of the worker thread to the browser.
    <p>Teaching focus: Multithreaded event handling.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="fullscreen_tumbler/index.html">Full-screen
  Tumbler</a></dt>
  <dd>This is a modified version of the Tumbler example above that supports
      full-screen display. It is in every way identical to Tumbler in
      functionality, except that it adds the ability to switch to/from
      full-screen display by pressing the Enter key.
   <p>Teaching focus: Full-screen</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="mouselock/index.html">Mouse Lock</a></dt>
  <dd>	The Mouselock example demonstrates how to use the MouseLock API to hide
  the mouse cursor.  Mouse lock is only available in full-screen mode.  You can
  lock and unlock the mouse while in full-screen mode by pressing the Enter key.

    <p>Teaching focus: Mouse lock, Full-screen</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="websocket/index.html">Websocket</a></dt>
  <dd>  The Websocket example demonstrates how to use the Websocket API.  The
  user first connects to the test server: ws://html5rocks.websocket.org/echo by
  clicking on the 'Connect'' button.  Then hitting Send' will cause the app to
  send the message to the server and retrieve the reply.
    <p>Teaching focus: Websockets</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="file_histogram/index.html">File Histogram</a></dt>
  <dd>  The File Histogram example demonstrates prompting the user for a file,
  passing the file contents to NativeClient as a VarArrayBuffer, then drawing a
  histogram representing the contents of the file to a 2D square.
    <p>Teaching focus: VarArrayBuffer, 2D, File input.</p>
