// HttpStream is an interface for reading and writing data to an HttpStream that
// keeps the client agnostic of the actual underlying transport layer.  This
// provides an abstraction for both a basic http stream as well as http
// pipelining implementations.  The HttpStream subtype is expected to manage the
// underlying transport appropriately.  For example, a non-pipelined HttpStream
// would return the transport socket to the pool for reuse.  SPDY streams on the
// other hand leave the transport socket management to the SpdySession.
