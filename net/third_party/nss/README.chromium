This directory includes a copy of NSS's libssl from the CVS repo at:
  :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot

The snapshot was updated to the CVS tag: NSS_3_12_9_RTM

Patches:

  * Next protocol negotiation support.
    patches/nextproto.patch
    http://codereview.chromium.org/415005

  * Commenting out a couple of functions because they need NSS symbols
    which may not exist in the system NSS library.
    patches/versionskew.patch

  * Send empty renegotiation info extension instead of SCSV unless TLS is
    disabled.
    patches/renegoscsv.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=549042

  * Cache the peer's intermediate CA certificates in session ID, so that
    they're available when we resume a session.  Add certificates to
    ss->ssl3.peerCertChain in the right order.
    patches/cachecerts.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=606049

  * Add the SSL_PeerCertificateChain function
    patches/peercertchain.patch

  * Add OCSP stapling support
    patches/ocspstapling.patch

  * Add support for client auth with native crypto APIs on Mac and Windows
    patches/clientauth.patch
    ssl/sslplatf.c

  * Don't send a client certificate when renegotiating if the peer does not
    request one. This only happened if the previous key exchange algorithm
    was non-RSA.
    patches/clientauth.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616757

  * Add support for TLS cached info extension.
    patches/cachedinfo.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665739

  * Add a function to export whether the last handshake on a socket resumed a
    previous session.
    patches/didhandshakeresume.patch

  * Start each set of CBC encrypted application data records, resulting from
    a single call to ssl3_SendApplicationData, with a one-byte application
    data record in order to randomize the IV in a backward compatible manner.
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665814
    patches/cbcrandomiv.patch

  * Support origin bound certificates.
    http://balfanz.github.com/tls-obc-spec/draft-balfanz-tls-obc-00.txt
    patches/origin_bound_certs.patch

  * Add a function to implement RFC 5705: Keying Material Exporters for TLS
    This is a reworked version of the patch from
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=507359
    patches/secret_exporter.patch

  * Send saved write data in the SSL socket in SSL_ForceHandshake.
    patches/handshakeshortwrite.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=676729

  * Add a function to restart a handshake after a client certificate request.
    patches/restartclientauth.patch

  * Allow SSL_HandshakeNegotiatedExtension to be called before the handshake
    is finished.
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=681839
    patches/negotiatedextension.patch

  * Support the encrypted client certificates extension.
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=691991

The ssl/bodge directory contains files taken from the NSS repo that we required
for building libssl outside of its usual build environment.
