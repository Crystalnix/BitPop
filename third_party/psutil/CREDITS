We would like to recognize some of the people who have been instrumental in the
development of psutil.
I'm sure we are forgetting some people (feel free to email us), but here is a
short list.
It's modeled after the Linux CREDITS file where the fields are:
name (N), e-mail (E), web-address (W), country (C), description (D), (I) issues
(issue tracker is at http://code.google.com/p/psutil/issues/list).
Really thanks to all of you.
