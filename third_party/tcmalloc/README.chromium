Revision: 93

Description:
This contains Chromium's locally patched copy of tcmalloc.

Contents:

  chromium/

    The chromium patched sources, copied from the vendor/
    subdirectory and containing our local modifications.

    We only copy over the vendor/src/ subdirectory (the only piece
    we need) but still leave it in a chromium/src/ subdirectory to
    keep the directory structures in parallel.

  vendor/

    Vanilla sources from upstream:

      http://google-perftools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

    The current revision is:

      Last Changed Rev: 93
      Last Changed Date: 2010-04-22 21:29:02 +0400 (Thu, 22 Apr 2010)



HOWTOs:

  Take a new version from upstream:

    1)  Grab the revision:

        $ svn export [-r {tcmalloc-rev}] \
          http://google-perftools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk \
          vendor-{tcmalloc-rev}

    2)  Check for added or deleted files:

        $ diff -q -r -x .svn vendor vendor-{tcmalloc-rev}

    3)  Copy the new revision on top of the checked-in vendor branch:

        $ cp -r vendor-{tcmalloc-rev}/* vendor

        C:\> xcopy /e/y/i vendor-{tcmalloc-rev}\* vendor

    4)  "svn add" or "svn rm" added or removed files (based on your
        "diff -q -r" output from above)

    5)  Create the CL, upload, check it in:

        $ gcl change CL
        $ gcl upload CL
        $ gcl commit CL

        Note the revision number since you're going to want to merge
        that to the local chromium branch.

  Merge a new upstream version with our local patched copy:

    1)  Merge the local revision to chromium/src

        $ svn merge -c {chrome-rev} svn://chrome-svn/chrome/trunk/src/third_party/tcmalloc/vendor/src chromium/src

    2)  Resolve any conflicts

    3)  Create the CL, upload, check in:

        $ gcl change CL
        $ gcl upload CL
        $ gcl commit CL
