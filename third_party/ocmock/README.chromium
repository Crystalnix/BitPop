Description:
OCMock is an Objective-C implementation of mock objects. If you are unfamiliar
with the concept of mock objects please visit mockobjects.com which has more
details and discussions about this approach to testing software.

Local Modifications:
This is only a partial inclusion of the OCMock tree. This only includes
/Source/OCMock because the tests and other files are not necessary for Chromium.
The License.txt and Changes.txt file are also present from /Source.

Chromium adds gtest_support.h/.mm and ocmock_extensions.h/.mm.
