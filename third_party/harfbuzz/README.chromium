This code was taken from d10a264823e81631336bab37f08a52cc243d3654
(git://anongit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz)

The patch in chromium.patch was applied on top of this; I will talk with
upstream about it.  (Note that chromium.patch is just a record of our
changes against upstream; you must also apply any changes that you make to
the checked-in copy of the source.)

Added support for building on Android.
