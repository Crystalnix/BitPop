WebP is an image format that does lossy compression of digital photographic
images. WebP consists of a codec based on VP8, that Google open-sourced in May
2010 and a container based on RIFF. Webmasters, web developers and browser
developers can use WebP to compress, archive and distribute digital images more
efficiently.
