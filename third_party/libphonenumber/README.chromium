Revision: 186
Security Critical: yes

This directory contains the source code of International Phone Number Library
for C/C++.

This library depends on
1. base/ for types, scoped_ptr's, etc.
2. third_party/icu for internationalisation, UTF8-16-32 conversion and regular
   expressions.
3. third_party/protobuf Lite version.

Additional files, not in the original library:
  libphonenumber.gyp
  README.chromium
  chrome/regexp_adapter_icuregexp.cc

Until the changes are upstreamed library is included directly, with a patch
in patches/version186.patch applied. The patch adds plugability to the regular
expression engine, its RE2 (default) implementation, and the unit-test for the
changes. The second patch utf8_v186.patch is applied to allow compilation on
some multi-byte locales.
