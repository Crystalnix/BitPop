Description:
versions 2.38, 2.94
gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPSes or AIS receivers
attached to a host computer through serial or USB ports, making all data on the
location/course/velocity of the sensors available to be queried on TCP port
2947 of the host computer. 

Local Modifications:
No modifications.
Only the gps.h file is imported, as the client library (libgps.so) is
dynamically loaded (where present). We import 2 versions as the older (2.38) is
needed for Chrome OS and the newer for tip of tree builds (using the new client
API that aims to maintain binary compatibility across future releases).
