/* TODO Add kana, hangul, and other small sahpers here */

/* When adding trivial shapers, eg. kana, hangul, etc, we can either
 * add a full shaper enum value for them, or switch on the script in
 * the default complex shaper.  The former is faster, so I think that's
 * what we would do, and hence the default complex shaper shall remain
 * empty.
