// Under some conditions the decoded frames can get invalid or wrong timestamps:
//    - compressed frames are often in decode timestamp (dts) order, which
//      may not always be in presentation timestamp (pts) order;
//    - decoder may report invalid timestamps for the decoded frames;
//    - parser may report invalid timestamps for the compressed frames.
//
// To ensure that the decoded frames are displayed in the proper order, the
// PtsStream class assembles the time information from different sources and
// combines it into the "best guess" timestamp and duration for the current
// frame. Data inside the decoded frame (if provided) is trusted the most,
// followed by data from the packet stream. Estimation based on the last known
// PTS and frame rate is reserved as a last-ditch effort.
