bear-320x240.webm - WebM encode of bear.1280x720.mp4 resized to 320x240.
no_streams.webm - Header, Info, & Tracks element from bear-320x240.webm slightly corrupted so it looks
                  like there are no tracks.
nonzero-start-time.webm - Has the same headers as bear-320x240.webm but the first cluster of this file
                          is the second cluster of bear-320x240.webm. This creates the situation where
                          the media data doesn't start at time 0.
vp8-I-frame-160x240 - The first I frame of a 160x240 reencode of bear-320x240.webm.
vp8-I-frame-320x120 - The first I frame of a 320x120 reencode of bear-320x240.webm.
