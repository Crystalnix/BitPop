// Implementation of AudioOutputStream for Windows using Windows Core Audio
// WASAPI for low latency rendering.
//
// Overview of operation and performance:
//
// - An object of WASAPIAudioOutputStream is created by the AudioManager
//   factory.
// - Next some thread will call Open(), at that point the underlying
//   Core Audio APIs are utilized to create two WASAPI interfaces called
//   IAudioClient and IAudioRenderClient.
// - Then some thread will call Start(source).
//   A thread called "wasapi_render_thread" is started and this thread listens
//   on an event signal which is set periodically by the audio engine to signal
//   render events. As a result, OnMoreData() will be called and the registered
//   client is then expected to provide data samples to be played out.
// - At some point, a thread will call Stop(), which stops and joins the
//   render thread and at the same time stops audio streaming.
// - The same thread that called stop will call Close() where we cleanup
//   and notify the audio manager, which likely will destroy this object.
// - Initial tests on Windows 7 shows that this implementation results in a
//   latency of approximately 35 ms if the selected packet size is less than
//   or equal to 20 ms. Using a packet size of 10 ms does not result in a
//   lower latency but only affects the size of the data buffer in each
//   OnMoreData() callback.
// - A total typical delay of 35 ms contains three parts:
//    o Audio endpoint device period (~10 ms).
//    o Stream latency between the buffer and endpoint device (~5 ms).
//    o Endpoint buffer (~20 ms to ensure glitch-free rendering).
// - Note that, if the user selects a packet size of e.g. 100 ms, the total
//   delay will be approximately 115 ms (10 + 5 + 100).
// - Supports device events using the IMMNotificationClient Interface. If
//   streaming has started, a so-called stream switch will take place in the
//   following situations:
//    o The user enables or disables an audio endpoint device from Device
//      Manager or from the Windows multimedia control panel, Mmsys.cpl.
//    o The user adds an audio adapter to the system or removes an audio
//      adapter from the system.
//    o The user plugs an audio endpoint device into an audio jack with
//      jack-presence detection, or removes an audio endpoint device from
//      such a jack.
//    o The user changes the device role that is assigned to a device.
//    o The value of a property of a device changes.
//   Practical/typical example: A user has two audio devices A and B where
//   A is a built-in device configured as Default Communication and B is a
//   USB device set as Default device. Audio rendering starts and audio is
//   played through the device B since the eConsole role is used by the audio
//   manager in Chrome today. If the user now removes the USB device (B), it
//   will be detected and device A will instead be defined as the new default
//   device. Rendering will automatically stop, all resources will be released
//   and a new session will be initialized and started using device A instead.
//   The net effect for the user is that audio will automatically switch from
//   device B to device A. Same thing will happen if the user now re-inserts
//   the USB device again.
//
// Implementation notes:
//
// - The minimum supported client is Windows Vista.
// - This implementation is single-threaded, hence:
//    o Construction and destruction must take place from the same thread.
//    o All APIs must be called from the creating thread as well.
// - It is recommended to first acquire the native sample rate of the default
//   input device and then use the same rate when creating this object. Use
//   WASAPIAudioOutputStream::HardwareSampleRate() to retrieve the sample rate.
// - Calling Close() also leads to self destruction.
// - Stream switching is not supported if the user shifts the audio device
//   after Open() is called but before Start() has been called.
// - Stream switching can fail if streaming starts on one device with a
//   supported format (X) and the new default device - to which we would like
//   to switch - uses another format (Y), which is not supported given the
//   configured audio parameters.
//
// Core Audio API details:
//
// - CoInitializeEx() is called on the creating thread and on the internal
//   capture thread. Each thread's concurrency model and apartment is set
//   to multi-threaded (MTA). CHECK() is called to ensure that we crash if
//   CoInitializeEx(MTA) fails.
// - The public API methods (Open(), Start(), Stop() and Close()) must be
//   called on constructing thread. The reason is that we want to ensure that
//   the COM environment is the same for all API implementations.
// - Utilized MMDevice interfaces:
//     o IMMDeviceEnumerator
//     o IMMDevice
// - Utilized WASAPI interfaces:
//     o IAudioClient
//     o IAudioRenderClient
// - The stream is initialized in shared mode and the processing of the
//   audio buffer is event driven.
// - The Multimedia Class Scheduler service (MMCSS) is utilized to boost
//   the priority of the render thread.
// - Audio-rendering endpoint devices can have three roles:
//   Console (eConsole), Communications (eCommunications), and Multimedia
//   (eMultimedia). Search for "Device Roles" on MSDN for more details.
// - The actual stream-switch is executed on the audio-render thread but it
//   is triggered by an internal MMDevice thread using callback methods
//   in the IMMNotificationClient interface.
//
// Threading details:
//
// - It is assumed that this class is created on the audio thread owned
//   by the AudioManager.
// - It is a requirement to call the following methods on the same audio
//   thread: Open(), Start(), Stop(), and Close().
// - Audio rendering is performed on the audio render thread, owned by this
//   class, and the AudioSourceCallback::OnMoreData() method will be called
//   from this thread. Stream switching also takes place on the audio-render
//   thread.
// - All callback methods from the IMMNotificationClient interface will be
//   called on a Windows-internal MMDevice thread.
//
// Experimental exclusive mode:
//
// - It is possible to open up a stream in exclusive mode by using the
//   --enable-exclusive-mode command line flag.
// - The internal buffering scheme is less flexible for exclusive streams.
//   Hence, some manual tuning will be required before deciding what frame
//   size to use. See the WinAudioOutputTest unit test for more details.
// - If an application opens a stream in exclusive mode, the application has
//   exclusive use of the audio endpoint device that plays the stream.
// - Exclusive-mode should only be utilized when the lowest possible latency
//   is important.
// - In exclusive mode, the client can choose to open the stream in any audio
//   format that the endpoint device supports, i.e. not limited to the device's
//   current (default) configuration.
// - Initial measurements on Windows 7 (HP Z600 workstation) have shown that
//   the lowest possible latencies we can achieve on this machine are:
//     o ~3.3333ms @ 48kHz <=> 160 audio frames per buffer.
//     o ~3.6281ms @ 44.1kHz <=> 160 audio frames per buffer.
// - See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370844(v=vs.85).aspx
//   for more details.
