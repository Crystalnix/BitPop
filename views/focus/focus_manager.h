// The FocusManager class is used to handle focus traversal, store/restore
// focused views and handle keyboard accelerators.
//
// There are 2 types of focus:
// - the native focus, which is the focus that an gfx::NativeView has.
// - the view focus, which is the focus that a views::View has.
//
// Each native view must register with their Focus Manager so the focus manager
// gets notified when they are focused (and keeps track of the native focus) and
// as well so that the tab key events can be intercepted.
// They can provide when they register a View that is kept in synch in term of
// focus. This is used in NativeControl for example, where a View wraps an
// actual native window.
// This is already done for you if you subclass the NativeControl class or if
// you use the NativeViewHost class.
//
// When creating a top window (derived from views::Widget) that is not a child
// window, it creates and owns a FocusManager to manage the focus for itself and
// all its child windows.
//
// The FocusTraversable interface exposes the methods a class should implement
// in order to be able to be focus traversed when tab key is pressed.
// RootViews implement FocusTraversable.
// The FocusManager contains a top FocusTraversable instance, which is the top
// RootView.
//
// If you just use views, then the focus traversal is handled for you by the
// RootView. The default traversal order is the order in which the views have
// been added to their container. You can modify this order by using the View
// method SetNextFocusableView().
//
// If you are embedding a native view containing a nested RootView (for example
// by adding a NativeControl that contains a WidgetWin as its native
// component), then you need to:
// - override the View::GetFocusTraversable() method in your outer component.
//   It should return the RootView of the inner component. This is used when
//   the focus traversal traverse down the focus hierarchy to enter the nested
//   RootView. In the example mentioned above, the NativeControl overrides
//   GetFocusTraversable() and returns hwnd_view_container_->GetRootView().
// - call Widget::SetFocusTraversableParent() on the nested RootView and point
//   it to the outer RootView. This is used when the focus goes out of the
//   nested RootView. In the example:
//   hwnd_view_container_->GetWidget()->SetFocusTraversableParent(
//      native_control->GetRootView());
// - call RootView::SetFocusTraversableParentView() on the nested RootView with
//   the parent view that directly contains the native window. This is needed
//   when traversing up from the nested RootView to know which view to start
//   with when going to the next/previous view.
//   In our example:
//   hwnd_view_container_->GetWidget()->SetFocusTraversableParent(
//      native_control);
//
// Note that FocusTraversable do not have to be RootViews: AccessibleToolbarView
// is FocusTraversable.
