// Wayland event information is being passed in as arguments to the callbacks.
// (See wayland_input_device.{h,cc} for information on the callbacks and how
// events are processed.)
// In order to provide a more generic look for events we wrap these arguments
// in specific event structs. Then define a WaylandEvent as a union of all
// types of events that Wayland will send.
//
// The following fields are common for most event types and their use is
// similar:
// - time:
//    The time of the event. This should be monotonically increasing.
// - state:
//    The value of the button event as given by evdev. This is 0 if button
//    isn't pressed.
// - modifiers:
//    Stores all the keyboard modifiers (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, ...) currently
//    active. The modifiers are values as defined by xkbcommon.
