// |png| represents the data of a png encoded image.

// RGB KMean Algorithm (N clusters, M iterations):
// TODO (dtrainor): Try moving most/some of this to HSV space?  Better for
// color comparisons/averages?
// 1.Pick N starting colors by randomly sampling the pixels. If you see a
//   color you already saw keep sampling. After a certain number of tries
//   just remove the cluster and continue with N = N-1 clusters (for an image
//   with just one color this should devolve to N=1). These colors are the
//   centers of your N clusters.
//   TODO (dtrainor): Check to ignore colors with an alpha of 0?
// 2.For each pixel in the image find the cluster that it is closest to in RGB
//   space. Add that pixel's color to that cluster (we keep a sum and a count
//   of all of the pixels added to the space, so just add it to the sum and
//   increment count).
// 3.Calculate the new cluster centroids by getting the average color of all of
//   the pixels in each cluster (dividing the sum by the count).
// 4.See if the new centroids are the same as the old centroids.
//     a) If this is the case for all N clusters than we have converged and
//        can move on.
//     b) If any centroid moved, repeat step 2 with the new centroids for up
//        to M iterations.
// 5.Once the clusters have converged or M iterations have been tried, sort
//   the clusters by weight (where weight is the number of pixels that make up
//   this cluster).
// 6.Going through the sorted list of clusters, pick the first cluster with the
//   largest weight that's centroid fulfills the equation
//   |darkness_limit| < SUM(R, G, B) < |brightness_limit|. Return that color.
//   If no color fulfills that requirement return the color with the largest
//   weight regardless of whether or not it fulfills the equation above.
