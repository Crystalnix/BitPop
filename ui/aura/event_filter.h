// An object that filters events sent to an owner window. The filter can stop
// further processing of events.
//
// When the Desktop receives an event, it determines the "target window" for
// the event, this is typically the visible window whose bounds most tightly
// enclose the event coordinates, in the case of mouse events, or the focused
// window, in the case of key events.
//
// The Desktop then walks up the hierarchy from the target to its own window,
// collecting a list of EventFilters. This list is notified in reverse order
// (i.e. descending, from the Desktop's own event filter). Each filter gets a
// chance to prevent further processing of the event and/or take other actions.
