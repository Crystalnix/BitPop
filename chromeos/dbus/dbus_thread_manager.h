// DBusThreadManager manages the D-Bus thread, the thread dedicated to
// handling asynchronous D-Bus operations.
//
// This class also manages D-Bus connections and D-Bus clients, which
// depend on the D-Bus thread to ensure the right order of shutdowns for
// the D-Bus thread, the D-Bus connections, and the D-Bus clients.
//
// CALLBACKS IN D-BUS CLIENTS:
//
// D-Bus clients managed by DBusThreadManager are guaranteed to be deleted
// after the D-Bus thread so the clients don't need to worry if new
// incoming messages arrive from the D-Bus thread during shutdown of the
// clients. The UI message loop is not running during the shutdown hence
// the UI message loop won't post tasks to D-BUS clients during the
// shutdown. However, to be extra cautious, clients should use
// WeakPtrFactory when creating callbacks that run on UI thread. See
// session_manager_client.cc for examples.
