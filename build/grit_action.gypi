# This file is meant to be included into an action to invoke grit in a
# consistent manner. To use this the following variables need to be
# defined:
#   grit_grd_file: string: grd file path
#   grit_out_dir: string: the output directory path

# It would be really nice to do this with a rule instead of actions, but it
# would need to determine inputs and outputs via grit_info on a per-file
# basis. GYP rules donâ€™t currently support that. They could be extended to
# do this, but then every generator would need to be updated to handle this.
