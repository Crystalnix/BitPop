// A class representing an attempt to synchronize the local syncable data
// store with a sync server. A SyncSession instance is passed as a stateful
// bundle to and from various SyncerCommands with the goal of converging the
// client view of data with that of the server. The commands twiddle with
// session status in response to events and hiccups along the way, set and
// query session progress with regards to conflict resolution and applying
// server updates, and access the SyncSessionContext for the current session
// via SyncSession instances.
